					<p>Hello Guys, I am NopeGamer. This is about me, I started coding in 5th standered when my computer teacher thought us about scratch app. I Liked it so much. I came home and asked me farther for a new laptop, but he said "You are so small right now to do coding.You should focus on Your study now" I was about to give up lerning codes. but the next day when my teacher again thought us about sratch more and said that "I know You guys are small to learn codes but this don't means to stop. You should try scratch at your home too" After our computer class ended, i went to teacher and told her that I dont have a pc to code but I really want to code. the she said "child, I know most of the childern who don have the thing that the have their inteset on and the children who have the thing they dont care anything about it" she then gave me permission to come to computer room in anytime in break. I was so happy and went to computer room that day. she toght me a little bit about scratch. I made a simple game "ping pong" in it. It was my first game that I made without coding. then she told me about a software called "python" it was a litle bit hard forme first but there i made a first software. "Caluculator". When i told my freinds that I made a caluculator using python, They laughed at me. I told them this is my first project, I will soon make a good software to shock you Guys!, then after weeks of coding, I finally made a Website using html and css I showed them that i made this with coding, They were shocked. SO this is my story How I started coding and I learned a thing that "We Should Never Give Up" And the main motive of this this was to theach You Guys that You Should Never Give </p>
